# FACIAL-RECOGNITION

Jupyter Notebook Guide for implementing Face Recognition and Face Verification algorithms with Tensorflow framework.

Face Recognition library used for detecting landmarks on faces.

Code involves implementation of triple loss function, togather with implementation of face verification and face recognition algorithms.

Encoded images to 128 dimensional embedding vectors.
